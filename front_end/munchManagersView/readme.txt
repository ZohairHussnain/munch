1) View the menu by scanning a QR code
2) Place orders through the web app
3) Pay for their order (in full or split with family/friends)

    Munch is made up of 3 Pages.
    
    1) The first page is the Customer View, which is a 
    mobile friendly webpage meant to be used my the customers 
    to view the menu, place orders, and pay. 
    
   
    2) The next page is the Chef's View, which is meant to be used on a tablet by
    the restaurant's chef. It shows the chef live customer orders, how much time 
    elapsed since the customer places the order, and any special requests that the
    customer has regarding the order. By pressing the send button next to an order, 
    the chef indicates to the data base that the order has been prepared and sent to the costumer, 
    this aids in calculating the average time taken to prepare each dish

    3) The third page is the Manager's view, it shows the restaurant important
    information regarding the operations of the restaurant, with live updates.
    This includes how many tables are occupied with customers, what each table ordered,
    What are the most popular dishes over the past day, week or month.
    This page also shows data on the average time taken to prepare a dish, and the 
    average rating. This page also allows for the manager to control and modify data
    regarding the restaurant, such as editing the menu items, and adding a new table.
    Note table numbers in the table view refer to the physical table numbers in the 
    restaurant. Pressing on a table shows its QR code, which when scaned takes the restaurant
    costumer to the ordering page on their mobile device.
