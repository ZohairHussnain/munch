Munch is a at the Table payment solution for seated restaurants. It allows the customers of a restaurant to:
1) View the menu by scanning a QR code
2) Place orders through the web app
3) Pay for their order (in full or split with family/friends)

    Munch is made up of 4 parts.
    
    1) The first part is the Customer View, which is a 
    mobile friendly webpage meant to be used my the customers 
    to view the menu, place orders, and pay. 
    
   
    2) The next part is the Chef's View, which is meant to be used on a tablet by
    the restaurant's chef. It shows the chef live customer orders, how much time 
    elapsed since the customer places the order. By pressing the send button next to an order, 
    the chef indicates to the data base that the order has been prepared and sent to the costumer, 
    this aids in calculating the average time taken to prepare each dish

    3) The third and fourth part is the Manager's view, it shows the restaurant important
    information regarding the operations of the restaurant, with live updates.
    This includes how many tables are occupied with customers, what each table ordered,
    What are the most popular dishes over the past day, week or month.
    This page also shows data on the average time taken to prepare a dish, and the 
    average rating. This page also allows for the manager to control and modify data
    regarding the restaurant, such as editing the menu items, and adding a new table.
    Note table numbers in the table view refer to the physical table numbers in the 
    restaurant. Pressing on a table shows its QR code, which when scaned takes the restaurant
    costumer to the ordering page on their mobile device.

Haitham:
I designed and implemented the front end for the Manager’s view, which included the tables view and Restaurant Statistics. The tables view allows the manager to see all the tables in the restaurant and their live status, with the border of the table’s card indicating whether the table is occupied or empty. Pressing on the table card shows the QR code associated with that table, allowing the manager to print out this codes easily. The restaurant statistics section shows important restaurant wide statistics. The manager can choose to see statistics from the past day week or month.

Zohair:
I designed the menu to be view by the manager, alowing them to add, edit, remove menu items as necessary. 

Mohammed:
For our project Munch, I designed and coded the Chef’s View page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I built the interactive order table that lets the chef view, add, and remove dishes dynamically, with styled elements using Bootstrap and the Cherry Bomb One font for branding.

Omar:
I designed and implemented the interactive menu section of the Munch website. I added JavaScript functionality to show and hide item lists, built counters for each item, and styled the layout to make it clean and easy to use.
